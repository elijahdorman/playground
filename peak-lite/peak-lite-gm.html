Healing Rates

Night rest heals Body
Night rest heals most of Body if
completely exhausted (0-1 dice
remaining)
Only partial dice recovery if
major injury is healing
Temporary Complication for
things like sprained ankle.




Advantage/Disadvantage

Each step of advantage or disadvantage is a 50%
change in effectiveness. The players should generally
have to put in quite a bit of planning, time, and effort
to change from one to the next.




Leveling Up

Each game session, players get between 1 and 3 dice to use.
Extra abilities cost dice equal to their level (no skipping
levels -- each preceeding level must be paid for). Some
abilities may have only one level, but it doesn't have to be
level 1. For example, troll hide may not get tougher over time
but in a fantasy campaign, it probably adds more than one die.
In such cases, all levels must be bought at once (for level 2,
that would be a total cost of 3 dice).

Not all abilities have dice, but most have levels of effect.
If only one level of effect, decide how valuable that ability
is to the game and set that level. The player must buy the
whole ability at once.

New abilities may be learned and complications may be overcome,
but only if doing so would stay within the story (and only with
GM permission).
