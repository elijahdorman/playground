# Mechanics

## Dice
We'll use Nd8 - 2 for damage
We'll use 3d16 - 2 for stats -- 1-7 is crit success. 40+ is crit failure
We'll use 3d32 - 2 for long-range selections -- no crit failure

damage should (on average) allow 10 hits from creatures of similar level
Crit success does 2x damage, lasts for 2x as long, etc
